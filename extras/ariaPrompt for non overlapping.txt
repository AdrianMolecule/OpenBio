python I have a long string and an unordered list of locations of substrings containint start and end indexes. The substrings can overlap. I need a method that order the list of locations based on the start position. Add a test with edge cases. Use camelCase notation. Also add a method that returns another ordered list of regions not containing substrings. Do not add blank lines of method documentation



    def getPreferenceByName(self, name):
        """Retrieve a preference by its name."""
        for preference in self.preferences:
            if preference.name == name:
                return preference
        return None  # Return None if no preference with that name is found

Summary of the Task:
The task is to write a Python method that finds overlapping substrings between two strings (longString and shortString). The method should:

Identify all unique overlaps: Find all substrings from shortString (with length at least minOverlapLength) that match substrings in longString.
Track both start and end positions: For each overlap, return the start and end positions in both longString and shortString.
Return the largest overlaps: Identify and return the largest overlaps in both longString and shortString. If multiple overlaps of the largest length exist, return all of them.
Key Features:
Overlaps: The method returns a list of tuples with the following details:
(start_in_longString, end_in_longString, start_in_shortString, end_in_shortString) for each overlap.
Largest Overlaps: The method returns:
A list of tuples for the largest overlaps in longString.
A list of tuples for the largest overlaps in shortString.
