python I have a long string and an unordered list of locations of substrings containint start and end indexes. The substrings can overlap. I need a method that order the list of locations based on the start position. Add a test with edge cases. Use camelCase notation. Also add a method that returns another ordered list of regions not containing substrings. Do not add blank lines of method documentation



    def getPreferenceByName(self, name):
        """Retrieve a preference by its name."""
        for preference in self.preferences:
            if preference.name == name:
                return preference
        return None  # Return None if no preference with that name is found
